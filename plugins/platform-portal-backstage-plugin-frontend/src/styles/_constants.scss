*
* THIS IS THE FILE TO UPDATE SITE-WIDE STYLE CHOICES FOR!!
*   It can override the colors or sizes set by default.
*   Below, we have provided the most likely variables to be
*   overridden
*
  ~~  TO BEGIN USING YOUR OWN COLORS  ~~
    1. Find the variable concept you are looking to override,
      -or- add another from those found in 
        '_default-constants.scss' in this folder.
    2. Change the value and uncomment the line.
    3. Repeat 1 & 2 for all cases needed.

    4. Done? In most cases, this should be all that is needed to
      get your version personalized. In more advanced cases, it 
      may be necessary to update one of other .scss files directly.
      If that happens, feel free to bring it up with us at Solo
      and we'll try to take it into account in the future.
